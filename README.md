Hi Jayne! Thank you for looking into this. Here's some files that might be useful. Lots of files. recommend looking at them following the numbering.


**nizaiwozai_20230309_combined_20230815.mp3** --> 4. and computer generated audio, generated from 2 again.<br>
**nizaiwozai_20230309_combined_20230815.mscz** --> 2. my attempt to turn it into a piano solo. mscz is a Musescore 3 file (a music notation program). may require installing the program.<br>
**nizaiwozai_20230309_combined_20230815.pdf** --> 3. in case you can't install musescore, here's a pdf generated from file 2. <br>
**nizaiwozai_piano_1-54.mp3**--> 5. the dynamics of 2 aren't well notated so the music generated(4) doesn't sound quite right. so I recorded bar 1-54. just to have a brief idea of what I hope the final thing might sound like<br>
**nizaiwozai_voiceremoved.mp3** --> 1. original music but with dialogues removed. Just singing vocal + bgm<br>
<br>
<br>
The part I'm having a problem with is bar 60-77(1:44-2:17). <br>
<br>
60-69 is just excessively hard to play with many dissonances,  but i still feel some part of the song is missing(?). Any comments on how my existing arrangement sounds to you? and any advice on whether I should overcome this part by more practicing or should I drop out some of the excessive notes to deal with both the dissonance and the difficulty problem(?)<br>
<br>
70-77 is disastrous. there's so much emptiness in it, might be because the entire violin melody is missing. but I'm not sure which octave should it be added into because I don't quite recognize the frequencies of a violin and I couldn't isolate it to analyse from the track. 
I have 2 temporary plans. one is to add it to E4-Dflat5 range(starting note Dflat5, 554Hz)(so it's a more natural extension from the fa mi re in bar69), and drop out the top notes melody in the manuscript. that part was from the piano, but the existing top melody sort of form octaves with the vocal melody near middle C. <br>
Another is to add it in E5-Dflat6  range(starting note Dflat6, 1108Hz), and move the entire existing right hand part to left hand part while giving up the existing left hand part. the existing left hand part is from the drums, I'm thinking if I can replace the drums with just an accent. another problem of this plan is that it doesn't connect with the fa mi re in bar69<br>
So my main question would be which octaves does the violin melody sounds to you?
